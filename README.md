# AI/ML Image classification project

In this project the main goal is to create an image classification system
using the torch module for neural networks in python. 

First part is a subtrain/validation split with two different neural
networks, computes gradients and network weight update steps using the
subtrain set, alaong with subtrain/validation loss.

Ploting is made against the number of epochs.
